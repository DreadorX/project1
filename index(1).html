        <p style="color:black;">This 5-ingredient, one-pan, 10-minute, no-peek chicken recipe is as good as it gets. It’s easy, delicious, it’s internet gold.

            We’re off to a great start!
            
            Besides the tender and juicy chicken, this casserole also contains rice, making it a complete dish on its own.
            
            A combination of canned mushroom soup and cream of celery soup gives it maximum richness and flavor, to boot.
            
            Wondering why it’s called no-peek chicken? That’s because this chicken doesn’t need any babysitting. Once it goes into the oven, your job is done.

        <h2>Coca-Cola Chicken</h2>
        <img src="https://insanelygoodrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Homemade-Coca-Cola-Chicken-1-750x1125.webp" alt="Coca-Cola Chicken">
        <p>While most people see Coke as a sweet, quench-thirsting beverage, to southerners, it’s a common ingredient to both sweet and savory dishes.

            In this recipe, Coke is used as a glaze to coat the chicken. You’ll love how it lends a sweet, almost caramel-like flavor to the bird.
            
            It also couldn’t be easier to make. Just throw all the ingredients in a dish, pop it in the oven, and your work is done.</p>

        <h2>Mississippi Pot Roast</h2>
        <img src="https://insanelygoodrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mississippi-Pot-Roast-750x1125.webp">
        <p>If you’ve never had Mississippi pot roast, you are in for a treat.

            This southern dish is made of fork-tender chuck roast cooked in a delicious au jus and spiced with pepperoncini peppers.
            
            It’s meaty, salty, and savory with a bit of a kick!
            
            Since it’s slow-cooked for several hours, the meat becomes so insanely tender that it melts in your mouth. 
            
            Sure, it takes hours to cook, but your involvement is very minimal. In fact, all you’ll need is to turn on the Crockpot, and it takes care of the rest.</p>
